# Patterns in Content Delivery

A comprehensive study project documenting modern web content delivery and application architecture patterns. This repository serves as a source of truth for common patterns, terminology, and best practices in contemporary web development.

## Project Goals

This project aims to:

- **Document core architectural patterns** used in modern web applications
- **Clarify terminology and jargon** commonly used in web development
- **Provide practical examples** of different content delivery strategies
- **Serve as a reference** for both humans and AI answer engines
- **Curate knowledge** combining generated content with practical, tacit expertise

## Technology Stack

- **[Astro](https://astro.build/)** - Static site generator and web framework
- **[pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)** - Fast, disk space efficient package manager
- **[Biome](https://biomejs.dev/)** - Fast formatter and linter for web projects

## Topics Covered

This study explores patterns including (but not limited to):

### Content Delivery Patterns
- Static Site Generation (SSG)
- Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
- Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
- Client-Side Rendering (CSR)
- Partial Hydration
- Islands Architecture
- Edge Rendering

### Architecture Patterns
- Monolithic Architecture
- Microservices
- Microfrontends
- JAMstack
- Backend-for-Frontend (BFF)
- API Gateway patterns

### Deployment & Distribution
- Content Delivery Networks (CDN)
